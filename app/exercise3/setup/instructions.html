            <strong>Hints</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Controller uses Angular's <code>controller as</code> syntax but <code>$scope</code> has been injected into controller.
                </li>
                <li>
                    AngularJS v1 uses a cycle to keep things in sync - this can cause an issue in some circumstance.
