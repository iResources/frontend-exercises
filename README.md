### Completing the exercises

_Pay attention to the instructions and don't deviate from them._

Most exercises have individual tasks.  AngularJS knowledge will help with parts of the exercises but is not necessary.  There are hints and links to documentation and you may do your own research in order to complete the tasks.  The exercises are reasonably simple and you should be able to complete them in a reasonable amount of time.

Plenty of the boilerplate has been filled in for you leaving you to focus on the tasks themselves.

Extra points will be given in places for unit testing & code clarity.
